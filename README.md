# Horizontal Calendar

This is a primitive horizontal calendar in Android.

## 📚 Introduction
Introducing
A horizontal calendar has been always a cool feature in Android development. I made this calendar so it is easy to understand and you can modify it later. The code is lazy, but for basic it is enough.
