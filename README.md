# Music player

This is a primitive music player for Android. It detects MP3 files in a phone and allows you to play them.

## üìö Introduction
* 4 main layouts for displaying music (home page, by album, by playlist, by favorites)
* Menu for individual music (rename, delete, view details, etc.)
* Add to list or favorites using database
* It uses the latest way of programming Android applications (Navigation, AndroidX, MVVM)

### Layouts

Main Layout showcase activity with all songs on phone. The second layout shows auto-generated albums. And the third shows how player itself looks like.

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
    <img src="img1.jpg" alt="Image 1" style="max-width: 200px; margin-right: 10px;">
    <img src="img2.jpg" alt="Image 2" style="max-width: 200px; margin-right: 10px;">
    <img src="img3.jpg" alt="Image 3" style="max-width: 200px;">
</div>

The app allows the user to edit MP3 files as he/she wants. Another option is to add a song to the queue or playlist or change the cove. You can search specific songs in the search bar and also filter search results.

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
    <img src="img4.jpg" alt="Image 4" style="max-width: 200px; margin-right: 10px;">
    <img src="img5.jpg" alt="Image 5" style="max-width: 200px; margin-right: 10px;">
    <img src="img6.jpg" alt="Image 6" style="max-width: 200px;">

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

This app is very old. It is recommended to test it with jdk-15 and beloved. Although I upgraded this app in 2024, originally it was created in 2017, so it might not work on every device. It had a problem with detecting MP3 files.
